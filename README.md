# wallpaper-change-and-hide-desctop-icons
#### Preface
This script is written for Windows (I have activated Windows 11 basic)

#### Using
Before using, open [wall.py] use any text editor and specify the path to the folders that contain wallpaper images. Also make sure that you have Python installed and all the necessary libraries.

Since to change the visibility of icons on the desktop, I use a combination of **win+f1**, which is used by Windows, run *[Disable F1 key.reg]* to disable the standard hotkey.

To use run [wpchange.py] using Python (with administrator rights).
Or you can create a task through the task scheduler so that the script runs automatically when the computer starts.

P.S.
I took the script to change the visibility of desktop icons [here] and changed it for myself.
